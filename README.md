# Cellular-Automata-Program-Concept
Cellular Automata used for educational purposes, 2.0 will change all UI and most code

The program consists of a duel window UI concept. This will not be used in 2.0 and will be replaced with a sliding UI for menu.

The concept of CA is the science of mapping and determining cellular growth through math. It consists of neighborhoods, a start point, end point, grid, birth and death numbers. 

If there are a certain birth number of cells within the neighborhhood, the the selected cell will grow, if not the it will be unchanged or die if the <=death number of cells are in the neighborhood. 

This project is incomplete and will be redesigned and replaced completely with a 2.0 version that is in development.

Some aspects that are not integrated:
-death numbers
-birth numbers
-alternate neighborhoods
-alternate colors
-saving
-loading
-adjustable windows size/zoom

This project can be used by anyone, completely open sourse. Do not contact me with issues, please consider that this is not a final product. The program does not have a .exe, must upload to MS Visual Studio and start.

Thank you,
Cameron
